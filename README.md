# Coffee_Prices

A data driven exploration into how distance from town centres affects coffee prices.

Fun data features:
* How many Yelp / Google reviews
* https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes
* Combined social media followers (use sherlock to find entire social media presence)
* Postcode
* Type of coffee [pub, restaurant, coffee shop]
* Can maybe scrape with this tool https://github.com/karlicoss/scrapyroo

# Fun Classifiers
* If I was to open up a coffee shop on location X, how much should I charge for coffee?

# Up Next
* [ ] - Scrape coffee prices, build the data set

# ToDo
* [ ] Scrape for all amenities and compare, although Black coffee is universal like the Economist's Big Mac Index
